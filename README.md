# CrashRepoter for Qt Apps 
After getting frustating to get crash reporter or crash reporter with proper license. I decided to create one. This is result.

Under dev. Not ready yet.

## Components
* breakpad : Google breakpad library ( BSD 3 license)
* CrashReporter : It will support features like send report,create github issue. 
* CrashHandler : Need to add inside Qt App. It will create crash report and trigger crash reporter.



# License
* Apache 2.0 license
